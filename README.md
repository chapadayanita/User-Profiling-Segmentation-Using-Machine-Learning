# User-Profiling-Segmentation-Using-Machine-Learning

🧠 User Profiling & Segmentation with Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to group (or segment) users based on their demographics, behavior, and online activity. By identifying patterns in the data, businesses can better understand their users and personalize marketing, content, or services
________________________________________
📁 Dataset Overview
●	Total Users: 1,000
●	Features: 16 columns, including:

○	Demographics: Age, Gender, Income Level, Education Level
○	Behavior: Likes & Reactions, Device Usage, Time Spent Online
○	Engagement: Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, Ad Interaction Time
○	Interests: Top Interests, Followed Accounts

________________________________________
🚀 Project Goals
●	Segment users into meaningful groups using unsupervised learning.
●	Analyze behavioral patterns within each segment.
●	Provide actionable insights for business or marketing teams.
●	Visualize user clusters in 2D using PCA.

✅ Steps Followed
1.	Load and inspect the dataset

2.	Encode categorical variables (like Gender, Education Level)

3.	Drop irrelevant fields (like User ID)

4.	Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler

5.	Use the Elbow Method to choose the best number of clusters

6.	Apply KMeans clustering to segment users

7.	Use PCA to reduce dimensions and visualize segments

8.	Profile each segment to interpret behaviors

9.	Save the trained model and scaler for future predictions

10.	Predict user segments for new incoming data (optional)

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
●	Python (Jupyter Notebook)
●	pandas, numpy
●	matplotlib, seaborn
●	scikit-learn (StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, KMeans, PCA)
●	pickle (for saving models)

________________________________________
🧑‍💼 Segment Examples (Hypothetical)
●	Segment 0: Young, mobile-first users with high ad engagement
●	Segment 1: Older users, low CTR, primarily desktop users
●	Segment 2: Average-income users with high conversion rates

________________________________________
📦 Output Files
●	kmeans_model.pkl — saved KMeans clustering model
●	scaler.pkl — saved StandardScaler object
●	segmented_users.csv — (optional) users with their assigned segment

📌 Use Cases
●	Targeted marketing campaigns
●	Personalized recommendations
●	Customer lifetime value prediction
●	Behavioral segmentation in product analytics
